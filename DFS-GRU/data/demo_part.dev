Science fiction	I think science fiction is an amazing genre for anything. Future science, technology, time travel, FTL travel, they're all such interesting concepts.	Hyperspace (science fiction) Hyperspace is a faster-than-light (FTL) method of traveling used in science fiction.Hyperspace (science fiction) It is typically described as an alternative sub-region of space co-existing with our own universe which may be entered using an energy field or other device.Hyperspace (science fiction) As seen in most fiction hyperspace is most succinctly described as a somewhere else within which the laws of general and special relativity decidedly do not apply – especially with respect to the speed of light being the cosmic speed limit.Hyperspace (science fiction) Entering and exiting said elsewhere thus directly enables travel near or faster than the speed of light – almost universally with the aid of extremely advanced technology.Science fiction Science fiction (often shortened to SF or sci-fi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life.Science fiction Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a literature of ideas.Science fiction It usually avoids the supernatural, unlike the related genre of fantasy.Science fiction Historically, science-fiction stories have had a grounding in actual science, but now this is only expected of hard science fiction.History of science fiction The literary genre of science fiction is diverse, and its exact definition remains a contested question among both scholars and devotees.History of science fiction This lack of consensus is reflected in debates about the genre's history, particularly over determining its exact origins.History of science fiction There are two broad camps of thought, one that identifies the genre's roots in early fantastical works such as the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh (earliest Sumerian text versions c. 2150–2000 BCE).History of science fiction A second approach argues that science fiction only became possible sometime between the 17th and early 19th centuries, following the scientific revolution and major discoveries in astronomy, physics, and mathematics.Science fiction film Science fiction film (or sci-fi film) is a genre that uses speculative, fictional science-based depictions of phenomena that are not fully accepted by mainstream science, such as extraterrestrial lifeforms, alien worlds, extrasensory perception and time travel, along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft, robots, cyborgs, interstellar travel or other technologies.Science fiction film Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition.Science fiction film In many cases, tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held.Time travel Time travel is the concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space by an object or a person, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in spacetime, either to an earlier time or to a later time, without the need for the time-traveling body to experience the intervening period in the usual sense.Time travel Time travel is a widely-recognized concept in philosophy and fiction.Time travel It was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel The Time Machine, which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination.List of starships in Stargate This is a list of fictional starships in the Stargate universe depicted through a series of television shows and three feature-length movies.List of starships in Stargate The Ancients are one of the most technologically advanced races in Stargate, and this is reflected in their starships.List of starships in Stargate Duplicates of these ships are utilized by their nanite creations, the Asurans, as they also possess knowledge of Ancient technology.List of starships in Stargate The Puddle Jumper or Jumper is a small spacecraft used extensively in the Stargate Atlantis series.List of starships in Stargate Puddle Jumpers were created by the Ancients and most exist within the city built by the Ancients known as Atlantis.History of US science fiction and fantasy magazines to 1950 Science fiction and fantasy magazines began to be published in the US in the 1920s.History of US science fiction and fantasy magazines to 1950 Stories with science fiction themes had been appearing for decades in pulp magazines such as Argosy, but there were no magazines that specialized in a single genre until 1915, when Street & Smith, one of the major pulp publishers, brought out Detective Story Magazine.History of US science fiction and fantasy magazines to 1950 The first magazine to focus solely on fantasy and horror was Weird Tales, which was launched in 1923, and established itself as the leading weird fiction magazine over the next two decades; writers such as H.P.History of US science fiction and fantasy magazines to 1950 Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith and Robert E. Howard became regular contributors.

Obsessive–compulsive disorder Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder where people feel the need to check things repeatedly, perform certain routines repeatedly (called rituals), or have certain thoughts repeatedly.Obsessive–compulsive disorder People are unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time.Obsessive–compulsive disorder Common activities include hand washing, counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked.Obsessive–compulsive disorder Some may have difficulty throwing things out.Obsessive–compulsive disorder These activities occur to such a degree that the person's daily life is negatively affected.Obsessive–compulsive disorder Often they take up more than an hour a day.Obsessive–compulsive disorder Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense.Automation bias Automation bias is the propensity for humans to favor suggestions from automated decision-making systems and to ignore contradictory information made without automation, even if it is correct.Automation bias This problem has come under increasing scrutiny as decision making in such critical contexts as intensive care units, nuclear power plants, and aircraft cockpits have increasingly involved computerized system monitors and decision aids.Automation bias Errors of automation bias tend to occur when decision-making involves a degree of dependence on computers or other automated aids and the human element is largely confined to monitoring the tasks underway.Icinga Icinga is an open source computer system and network monitoring application.Icinga It was originally created as a fork of the Nagios system monitoring application in 2009.Icinga Icinga is attempting to get past perceived short-comings in Nagios' development process, as well as adding new features such as a modern Web 2.0 style user interface, additional database connectors (for MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL), and a REST API that lets administrators integrate numerous extensions without complicated modification of the Icinga core.Icinga The Icinga developers also seek to reflect community needs more closely and to integrate patches more quickly.Aceh Monitoring Mission The Aceh Monitoring Mission (AMM) was established by the European Union after the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the Free Ache Movement was signed on 15 August 2005 in Helsinki, Finland.Aceh Monitoring Mission The AMM is one of many missions under the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy.Aceh Monitoring Mission The Aceh Monitoring Mission, led by Mr Pieter Feith from the EU, was established to monitor the implementation of various aspects of the peace agreement set out in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in August 2005.Aceh Monitoring Mission The European Union, together with five contributing countries from ASEAN (Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, Philippines and Singapore), Norway and Switzerland, provided monitors for the peace process in Aceh (Indonesia).Functional programming In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.Functional programming It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.Functional programming In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state.Bicalutamide Bicalutamide, sold under the brand name Casodex among others, is an antiandrogen medication that is primarily used to treat prostate cancer.Bicalutamide It is typically used together with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue or surgical removal of the testicles to treat advanced prostate cancer.Bicalutamide Bicalutamide may also be used to treat excessive hair growth in women, as a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women, to treat early puberty in boys, and to prevent overly long-lasting erections in men.Bicalutamide It is taken by mouth.Bicalutamide Common side effects in men include breast enlargement, breast tenderness, and hot flashes.Vigilance (psychology) In modern psychology, vigilance, also termed sustained concentration, is defined as the ability to maintain concentrated attention over prolonged periods of time.Vigilance (psychology) During this time, the person attempts to detect the appearance of a particular target stimulus.Vigilance (psychology) The individual watches for a signal stimulus that may occur at an unknown time.Vigilance (psychology) The study of vigilance has expanded since the 1940s mainly due to the increased interaction of people with machines for applications involving monitoring and detection of rare events and weak signals.Vigilance (psychology) Such applications include air traffic control, inspection and quality control, automated navigation, military and border surveillance, and lifeguarding.

I have homebrewed before. Beer can be fun to craft.	basically homebrewing is personal small scale beer  production	Homebrewing Homebrewing is the brewing of beer on a small scale for personal, non-commercial purposes.Homebrewing Beer has been brewed on the domestic level since its advent, thousands of years prior to its commercial production, although its legality has varied according to local regulation.Homebrewing Beer has been brewed domestically throughout its 7,000-year history, beginning in the Neolithic period in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), Egypt and China.Homebrewing It seems to have first developed as thick beers; during this time meads, fruit wines and rice wines were also developed.Homebrewing Women brewers dominated alcohol production on every occupied continent until commercialization and industrialization of brewing occurred.Microbrewery A microbrewery or craft brewery is a brewery that produces small amounts of beer (or sometimes root beer), typically much smaller than large-scale corporate breweries, and is independently owned.Microbrewery Such breweries are generally characterized by their emphasis on quality, flavour and brewing technique.Microbrewery The microbrewing movement began in the United Kingdom in the 1970s although traditional artisanal brewing existed in Europe for centuries and subsequently spread to other countries.Microbrewery As the movement grew and some breweries expanded their production and distribution, the more encompassing concept of craft brewing emerged.Beer in the United States Beer in the United States is manufactured by more than 3,000 breweries, which range in size from industry giants to brew pubs and microbreweries.Beer in the United States The United States produced 196 million barrels () of beer in 2012, and consumes roughly of beer per capita annually.Beer in the United States In 2011, the United States was ranked fifteenth in the world in per capita consumption, while total consumption was second only to China.Beer in the United States Although beer was a part of colonial life in the United States, the passing of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1919 resulted in the prohibition of alcoholic beverage sales, forcing nearly all American breweries to close or switch to producing non-alcoholic products.Beer Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea.Beer Beer is brewed from cereal grains—most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used.Beer During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer.Beer Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and stabilizing agent.Beer Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops.Grodziskie Grodziskie (; other names: Grätzer, Grodzisz) is a historical style of beer from Poland that is typically made from oak-smoked wheat malt.Grodziskie The beer can be described as having a clear, light golden color, high carbonation, low alcohol content, low to moderate levels of hop bitterness, and a strong smoke flavor and aroma.Grodziskie The taste is light and crisp, with primary flavors coming from the smoked malt, the high mineral content of the water, and the strain of yeast used to ferment the beverage.Grodziskie The beer was nicknamed Polish Champagne because of its high carbonation levels, and because it was valued as a high-quality beverage to be used for special occasions.Pearl Brewing Company The Pearl Brewing Company (also known as the Pearl Brewery or just Pearl) was an American brewery, established in 1883 in Downtown San Antonio, Texas, USA.Pearl Brewing Company In 1985, Pearl's parent company purchased the Pabst Brewing Company and assumed the Pabst name.Pearl Brewing Company In 1999, the Pabst Brewing Company began transferring its production to Miller Brewing, on a contract basis, and closing all of its breweries.Pearl Brewing Company Pearl beer is still in production at Miller's Ft.

I did not know that. I bet they made some great beer.	the reason women did it mostly because it was considered a part of baking	Baking powder Baking powder is a dry chemical leavening agent, a mixture of a carbonate or bicarbonate and a weak acid and is used for increasing the volume and lightening the texture of baked goods.Baking powder Baking powder works by releasing carbon dioxide gas into a batter or dough through an acid-base reaction, causing bubbles in the wet mixture to expand and thus leavening the mixture.Baking powder Baking powder is used instead of yeast for end-products where fermentation flavors would be undesirable or where the batter lacks the elastic structure to hold gas bubbles for more than a few minutes, or to speed the production.Baking powder Because carbon dioxide is released at a faster rate through the acid-base reaction than through fermentation, breads made by chemical leavening are called quick breads.Baking Baking is a method of cooking food that uses prolonged dry heat, normally in an oven, but also in hot ashes, or on hot stones.Baking The most common baked item is bread but many other types of foods are baked.Baking Heat is gradually transferred from the surface of cakes, cookies, and breads to their centre.Baking As heat travels through, it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods with a firm dry crust and a softer centre.Baking Baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods simultaneously, or one after the other.Baking Baking is related to barbecuing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit.Nordic bread culture Nordic bread culture has existed in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden from prehistoric time through to the present.Nordic bread culture Four grain types dominated in the Nordic countries: barley and rye are the oldest; wheat and oats are more recent.Nordic bread culture During the Iron Age (500 AD – 1050 AD), rye became the most commonly used grain, followed by barley and oats.Nordic bread culture Rye was also the most commonly used grain for bread up until the beginning of the 20th century.Nordic bread culture Today, older grain types such as emmer and spelt are once again being cultivated and new bread types are being developed from these grains.Nordic bread culture Archaeological finds in Denmark indicate use of the two triticum (wheat) species, emmer and einkorn, during the Mesolithic Period (8900 BC – 3900 BC).Mexican breads Mexican breads and other baked goods are the result of centuries of experimentation and the blending of influence from various European baking traditions.Mexican breads Wheat, and bread baked from it, was introduced by the Spanish at the time of the Conquest.Mexican breads The French influence in Mexican Bread is the strongest.Mexican breads From the bolillo evolving from a French baguette to the concha branching out from a French brioche even the terminology comes from France.Mexican breads A baño maría, meaning a water bath for a custard type budín or bread pudding comes from the French word bain marie.Mexican breads Mexican bread While the consumption of wheat has never surpassed that of corn in the country, wheat is still a staple food and an important part of everyday and special rituals.Women's mixed martial arts While mixed martial arts is primarily a male dominated sport, it does have female athletes.Women's mixed martial arts Female competition in Japan includes promotions such as DEEP Jewels.Women's mixed martial arts Now defunct promotions that featured female fighters were Valkyrie, and Smackgirl.Women's mixed martial arts Professional mixed martial arts organizations in the United States that invite women to compete are industry leader Ultimate Fighting Championship, the all female Invicta Fighting Championships, Resurrection Fighting Alliance, Bellator Fighting Championships, and Legacy Fighting Championship.Women's mixed martial arts Now defunct promotions that featured female fighters were Strikeforce and EliteXC.Sodium bicarbonate Sodium bicarbonate (IUPAC name: sodium hydrogen carbonate), commonly known as baking soda, is a chemical compound with the formula NaHCO.Sodium bicarbonate It is a salt composed of sodium ions and bicarbonate ions.Sodium bicarbonate Sodium bicarbonate is a white solid that is crystalline but often appears as a fine powder.Sodium bicarbonate It has a slightly salty, alkaline taste resembling that of washing soda (sodium carbonate).Sodium bicarbonate The natural mineral form is nahcolite.Sodium bicarbonate It is a component of the mineral natron and is found dissolved in many mineral springs.Sodium bicarbonate It is among the European Union-encoded food additives, identified as E 500.Sodium bicarbonate Because it has long been known and is widely used, the salt has many related names such as baking soda, bread soda, cooking soda, and bicarbonate of soda.Women migrant workers from developing countries Since the late 20th century, substantial labour migration from developing countries to high-income countries has occurred.Women migrant workers from developing countries This includes a substantial portion of female migrants.Women migrant workers from developing countries The term feminization of migration has been proposed as a suggested gendered pattern in international migration where there is a trend towards a higher percentage of women among voluntary migrants.Women migrant workers from developing countries Studies on women migrant workers in high-income countries tend to focus on their employment in domestic work and care work for dual-income families.Women migrant workers from developing countries For more than 4 decades, female migrant numbers have rivaled those of male migrants.

oh wow thats cool	I know, and the frequency is lower in other populations.	Genetic studies on Jews Genetic studies on Jews are part of the population genetics discipline and are used to better understand the chronology of migration provided by research in other fields, such as history, archaeology, linguistics, and paleontology.Genetic studies on Jews These studies investigate the origins of various Jewish populations today.Genetic studies on Jews In particular, they investigate whether there is a common genetic heritage among various Jewish populations.Genetic studies on Jews Studies of autosomal DNA, which look at the entire DNA mixture, show that Jewish populations have tended to form relatively closely related groups in independent communities, with most in a community sharing significant ancestry and up to 75% Levantine genes.Genetic studies on Croats Population genetics is a scientific discipline which contributes to the examination of the human evolutionary and historical migrations.Genetic studies on Croats Particularly useful information is provided by research of two uniparental markers within our genome, the Y-chromosome (Y-DNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).Genetic studies on Croats The studied data suggests that around 3/4 of the contemporary Croatian male individuals are the descendants of Old Europeans who came here before and after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), while the rest of the population from those who arrived in the last 10,000 years, mostly during the Neolithic period.Genetic studies on Croats The contemporary Croatian female individuals have genetic diversity which fits within a broader European maternal genetic landscape.Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia The study of the genetics and archaeogenetics of the ethnic groups of South Asia aims at uncovering these groups' genetic history.Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia The geographic position of the South Asia makes its biodiversity important for the study of the early dispersal of anatomically modern humans across Asia.Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia Studies based on mtDNA variation have reported genetic unity across various South Asian sub–populations.Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia Conclusions of studies based on Y Chromosome variation and Autosomal DNA variation have been varied, although many researchers argue that most of the ancestral nodes of the phylogenetic tree of all the mtDNA types originated in South Asia.Haplogroup O-M122 In human population genetics, haplogroups define the major lineages of direct paternal (male) lines back to a shared common ancestor in Africa.Haplogroup O-M122 Haplogroup O-M122 （also known as Haplogroup O2 (formerly Haplogroup O3)）is an Eastern Eurasian Y-chromosome haplogroup.Haplogroup O-M122 The lineage ranges across Southeast Asia and East Asia, where it dominates the paternal lineages with extremely high frequencies.Haplogroup O-M122 This lineage is a descendant haplogroup of haplogroup O-M175.Haplogroup O-M122 Researchers believe that O-M122 first appeared in Southeast Asia approximately 25,000-30,000 years ago or roughly between 30,000 and 35,000 years ago according to more recent studies (Karmin et al.Genetic studies on Moroccans Moroccan genetics encompasses the genetic history of the people of Morocco, and the genetic influence of this ancestry on world populations.Genetic studies on Moroccans It has been heavily influenced by geography.Genetic studies on Moroccans In prehistoric times, the Sahara desert to the south and the Mediterranean Sea to the north were important geographical barriers.Genetic studies on Moroccans West Asia and Northeast Africa form a single land mass at the Suez.Genetic studies on Moroccans The Maghreb and Southwest Europe are separated by only 15 km (9 mi) at the Straits of Gibraltar, and a similar distance separates the Horn of Africa from the Arabian peninsula at the Bab el-Mandeb strait.Genetic studies on Moroccans At periods of low sea-levels, such as during a glacial maximum, islands that are currently submerged in the Mediterranean, and possibly in between the Gibraltar straits, would have been habitable.Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas The genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas primarily focuses on Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups and Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups.Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas Autosomal atDNA markers are also used, but differ from mtDNA or Y-DNA in that they overlap significantly.Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas The genetic pattern indicates Indigenous Amerindians experienced two very distinctive genetic episodes; first with the initial peopling of the Americas, and secondly with European colonization of the Americas.Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas The former is the determinant factor for the number of gene lineages, zygosity mutations and founding haplotypes present in today's Indigenous Amerindian populations.Quantitative genetics Quantitative genetics is a branch of population genetics that deals with phenotypes that vary continuously (in characters such as height or mass)—as opposed to discretely identifiable phenotypes and gene-products (such as eye-colour, or the presence of a particular biochemical).Quantitative genetics Both branches use the frequencies of different alleles of a gene in breeding populations (gamodemes), and combine them with concepts from simple Mendelian inheritance to analyze inheritance patterns across generations and descendant lines.Quantitative genetics While population genetics can focus on particular genes and their subsequent metabolic products, quantitative genetics focuses more on the outward phenotypes, and makes summaries only of the underlying genetics.
yea i think its the genes	I guess so, since it appears when two copies of the recessive allele on chromosome 16 is present.	Dominance (genetics) Dominance in genetics is a relationship between alleles of one gene, in which the effect on phenotype of one allele masks the contribution of a second allele at the same locus.Dominance (genetics) The first allele is dominant and the second allele is recessive.Dominance (genetics) For genes on an autosome (any chromosome other than a sex chromosome), the alleles and their associated traits are autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive.Dominance (genetics) Dominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics.Dominance (genetics) Often the dominant allele codes for a functional protein whereas the recessive allele does not.Dominance (genetics) A classic example of dominance is the inheritance of seed shape in peas.Zygosity Zygosity is the degree of similarity of the alleles for a trait in an organism.Zygosity Most eukaryotes have two matching sets of chromosomes; that is, they are diploid.Zygosity Diploid organisms have the same loci on each of their two sets of homologous chromosomes except that the sequences at these loci may differ between the two chromosomes in a matching pair and that a few chromosomes may be mismatched as part of a chromosomal sex-determination system.Zygosity If both alleles of a diploid organism are the same, the organism is homozygous at that locus.Zygosity If they are different, the organism is heterozygous at that locus.Mendelian inheritance Mendelian inheritance is a type of biological inheritance that follows the laws originally proposed by Gregor Mendel in 1865 and 1866 and re-discovered in 1900.Mendelian inheritance These laws were initially controversial.Mendelian inheritance When Mendel's theories were integrated with the Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory of inheritance by Thomas Hunt Morgan in 1915, they became the core of classical genetics.Mendelian inheritance Ronald Fisher combined these ideas with the theory of natural selection in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, putting evolution onto a mathematical footing and forming the basis for population genetics within the modern evolutionary synthesis.Red hair Red hair (or ginger hair) occurs naturally in 1–2% of the human population.Red hair It occurs more frequently (2–6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations.Red hair Red hair appears most commonly in people with two copies of a recessive allele on chromosome 16 which produces an altered version of the MC1R protein.Red hair Red hair varies in hues from a deep burgundy or bright copper (reddish-brown or auburn) through to burnt orange or red-orange and strawberry blond.Red hair It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin.Introduction to genetics Genetics is the study of genes—what they are, what they do, and how they work.Introduction to genetics Genes inside the nucleus of a cell are strung together in such a way that the sequence carries information: that information determines how living organisms inherit various features (phenotypic traits).Introduction to genetics For example, offspring produced by sexual reproduction usually look similar to each of their parents because they have inherited some of each of their parents' genes.Introduction to genetics Genetics identifies which features are inherited, and explains how these features pass from generation to generation.Introduction to genetics In addition to inheritance, genetics studies how genes are turned on and off to control what substances are made in a cell—gene expression; and how a cell divides—mitosis or meiosis.Solid white (chicken plumage) In poultry standards, solid white is coloration of plumage in chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) characterized by a uniform pure white color across all feathers, which is not generally associated with depigmentation in any other part of the body.Solid white (chicken plumage) Color is an important feature of most living organisms.Solid white (chicken plumage) In the wild, color has great significance affecting the survival and reproductive success of the species.Solid white (chicken plumage) The environmental constraints which lead to the specific colors of birds and animals are very strong and individuals of novel colors tend not to survive.Solid white (chicken plumage) Under domestication, mankind has transformed all the species involved which have thus been freed from environmental pressures to a large extent.Preimplantation genetic diagnosis Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD or PIGD) is the genetic profiling of embryos prior to implantation (as a form of embryo profiling), and sometimes even of oocytes prior to fertilization.Preimplantation genetic diagnosis PGD is considered in a similar fashion to prenatal diagnosis.Preimplantation genetic diagnosis When used to screen for a specific genetic disease, its main advantage is that it avoids selective pregnancy termination as the method makes it highly likely that the baby will be free of the disease under consideration.Preimplantation genetic diagnosis PGD thus is an adjunct to assisted reproductive technology, and requires in vitro fertilization (IVF) to obtain oocytes or embryos for evaluation.
Romance (love)	I don't know how to be romantic. I have trouble expressing emotional attraction.	Romance (love) Romance is the expressive and pleasurable feeling from an emotional attraction towards another person.Romance (love) This feeling is associated with, but does not necessitate, sexual attraction.Romance (love) For most people it is eros rather than agape, philia, or storge.Romance (love) In the context of romantic love relationships, romance usually implies an expression of one's strong romantic love, or one's deep and strong emotional desires to connect with another person intimately or romantically.Romance (love) Historically, the term romance originates with the medieval ideal of chivalry as set out in its chivalric romance literature.Romance (love) Humans have a natural inclination to form bonds with one another through social interactions, be it through verbal communication or nonverbal gestures.Love Love encompasses a variety of different emotional and mental states, typically strongly and positively experienced, ranging from the deepest interpersonal affection to the simplest pleasure.Love An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse differs from the love of food.Love Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love Love can also be a virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection—the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another.Love It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self or animals.Pansexuality Pansexuality, or omnisexuality, is the sexual, romantic or emotional attraction towards people regardless of their sex or gender identity.Pansexuality Pansexual people may refer to themselves as gender-blind, asserting that gender and sex are not determining factors in their romantic or sexual attraction to others.Pansexuality Pansexuality may be considered a sexual orientation in its own right or a branch of bisexuality, to indicate an alternative sexual identity.Pansexuality Because pansexual people are open to relationships with people who do not identify as strictly men or women, and pansexuality therefore rejects the gender binary, it is often considered a more inclusive term than bisexual.Group emotion Group emotion refers to the moods, emotions and dispositional affects of a group of people.Group emotion It can be seen as either an emotional entity influencing individual members' emotional states (top down) or the sum of the individuals' emotional states (bottom up).Group emotion This view sees the group's dynamic processes as responsible for an elusive feeling state which influences the members' feelings and behavior.Group emotion This view, that groups have an existence as entities beyond the characters that comprise them, has several angles.Group emotion One angle of this approach was depicted in early works such as Le Bon's and Freud's who reasoned that there is a general influence of a crowd or group which makes the members of the group feel, think and act differently then they would have as isolated individuals.Cross-sex friendship A cross-sex friendship is a platonic relationship between an unrelated man and woman.Cross-sex friendship There are multiple types of cross-sex friendships, all defined by whether or not each party has a romantic attraction to each other, or perceives that the other is interested.Cross-sex friendship A few theories have been developed to explain the existence of such friendships.Cross-sex friendship Research has been done on why men and women initiate these relationships, how they are perceived by others, implications for children with cross-sex friendships, among others.Cross-sex friendship Cross-sex friendships can also create problems for those involved if either or both have or ever had any romantic feelings for the other.Mr. Darcy Fitzwilliam Darcy, generally referred to as Mr. Darcy, is one of the two central characters in Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice.Mr. Darcy He is an archetype of the aloof romantic hero, and a romantic interest of Elizabeth Bennet, the novel's protagonist.Mr. Darcy The story's narration is almost exclusively from Elizabeth's perspective; the reader is given a one-sided view of Darcy for much of the novel, but hints are given throughout that there is much more to his good character than meets the eye.Mr. Darcy The reader gets a healthy dose of dramatic irony as Elizabeth continually censures (with some prejudice) Mr. Darcy's character despite the aforementioned hints (via the narrative voice and other characters' observations) that Mr. Darcy is really a noble character at heart, albeit somewhat prideful.Heterosexuality Heterosexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior between persons of the opposite sex or gender.Heterosexuality As a sexual orientation, heterosexuality is an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to persons of the opposite sex; it also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions.Heterosexuality Along with bisexuality and homosexuality, heterosexuality is one of the three main categories of sexual orientation within the heterosexual–homosexual continuum.Heterosexuality Someone who is heterosexual is commonly referred to as straight.
I feel the same. I find it hard to make many friends so finding a romantic partner seems impossible.	The term "romance" originated in the medieval ideal of chivalry.	Chivalry Chivalry, or the chivalric code, is an informal, varying code of conduct developed between 1170 and 1220, never decided on or summarized in a single document, associated with the medieval institution of knighthood; knights’ and gentlewomen's behaviors were governed by chivalrous social codes.Chivalry The ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature, especially the Matter of Britain and Matter of France, the former based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae which introduced the legend of King Arthur, written in the 1130s.Chivalry The code of chivalry that developed in medieval Europe had its roots in earlier centuries.Romance (love) Romance is the expressive and pleasurable feeling from an emotional attraction towards another person.Romance (love) This feeling is associated with, but does not necessitate, sexual attraction.Romance (love) For most people it is eros rather than agape, philia, or storge.Romance (love) In the context of romantic love relationships, romance usually implies an expression of one's strong romantic love, or one's deep and strong emotional desires to connect with another person intimately or romantically.Romance (love) Historically, the term romance originates with the medieval ideal of chivalry as set out in its chivalric romance literature.Romance (love) Humans have a natural inclination to form bonds with one another through social interactions, be it through verbal communication or nonverbal gestures.Knight A knight is a person granted an honorary title of knighthood by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity.Knight Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors.Knight During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility.Knight By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior.Knight Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings.Knight The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback.Sir Gawain and the Green Knight Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (Middle English: Sir Gawayn and þe Grene Knyȝt) is a late 14th-century Middle English chivalric romance.Sir Gawain and the Green Knight It is one of the best known Arthurian stories, with its plot combining two types of folklore motifs, the beheading game and the exchange of winnings.Sir Gawain and the Green Knight The Green Knight is interpreted by some as a representation of the Green Man of folklore and by others as an allusion to Christ.Sir Gawain and the Green Knight Written in stanzas of alliterative verse, each of which ends in a rhyming bob and wheel, it draws on Welsh, Irish, and English stories, as well as the French chivalric tradition.Sir Gawain and the Green Knight It is an important example of a chivalric romance, which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest which tests his prowess, and it remains popular to this day in modern English renderings from J. R. R. Tolkien, Simon Armitage, and others, as well as through film and stage adaptations.Gentry Gentry (from Old French genterie, from gentil, high-born, noble) are well-born, genteel and well-bred people of high social class, especially in the past.Gentry Gentry, in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and gentle families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms.Gentry The historical term gentry by itself, so Peter Coss argues, is a construct that historians have applied loosely to rather different societies.Gentry Any particular model may not fit a specific society, yet a single definition nevertheless remains desirable.King Arthur King Arthur is a legendary British leader who, according to medieval histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries AD.King Arthur The details of Arthur's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention, and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians.King Arthur The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources, including the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas.King Arthur Arthur's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin.King Arthur Arthur is a central figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain.Brian R.

Interesting. I feel that today the meaning has been changed to fit with Hollywood's idea of romance.	For sure. Romantic love is relative but usually accepted as moments of intimacy.	Romance (love) Romance is the expressive and pleasurable feeling from an emotional attraction towards another person.Romance (love) This feeling is associated with, but does not necessitate, sexual attraction.Romance (love) For most people it is eros rather than agape, philia, or storge.Romance (love) In the context of romantic love relationships, romance usually implies an expression of one's strong romantic love, or one's deep and strong emotional desires to connect with another person intimately or romantically.Romance (love) Historically, the term romance originates with the medieval ideal of chivalry as set out in its chivalric romance literature.Romance (love) Humans have a natural inclination to form bonds with one another through social interactions, be it through verbal communication or nonverbal gestures.Love Love encompasses a variety of different emotional and mental states, typically strongly and positively experienced, ranging from the deepest interpersonal affection to the simplest pleasure.Love An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse differs from the love of food.Love Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love Love can also be a virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection—the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another.Love It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self or animals.Sexual desire and intimate relationships Definitions of sexual desire are broad and understandings of sexual desire are subjective.Sexual desire and intimate relationships However, the development of various ways of measuring the construct allows for extensive research to be conducted that facilitates the investigation of influences of sexual desire.Sexual desire and intimate relationships Particular differences have been observed between the sexes in terms of understanding sexual desire both with regard to one's own sexual desires, as well as what others desire sexually.Sexual desire and intimate relationships These beliefs and understandings all contribute to how people behave and interact with others, particularly in terms of various types of intimate relationships.Neuroanatomy of intimacy Even though intimacy has been broadly defined in terms of romantic love and sexual desire, the neuroanatomy of intimacy needs further explanation in order to fully understand their neurological functions in different components within intimate relationships, which are romantic love, lust, attachment, and rejection in love.Neuroanatomy of intimacy Also, known functions of the neuroanatomy involved can be applied to observations seen in people who are experiencing any of the stages in intimacy.Neuroanatomy of intimacy Research analysis of these systems provide insight on the biological basis of intimacy, but the neurological aspect must be considered as well in areas that require special attention to mitigate issues in intimacy, such as violence against a beloved partner or problems with social bonding.Triangular theory of love ￼  The triangular theory of love is a theory of love developed by psychologist Robert Sternberg.Triangular theory of love Presented in 1985, Sternberg was a member of the Psychology Department at Yale University.Triangular theory of love During his time as a professor, Sternberg emphasized his research in the fields of intelligence, creativity, wisdom, leadership, thinking styles, ethical reasoning, love, and hate.Triangular theory of love In the context of interpersonal relationships, the three components of love, according to the triangular theory, are an intimacy component, a passion component, and a decision/commitment component.Triangular theory of love There are three components of love as follows:  Passion: Passion can be associated with either physical arousal or emotional stimulation.Romance novel The romance novel or romantic novel discussed in this article is the mass-market literary genre.Romance novel Novels of this type of genre fiction place their primary focus on the relationship and romantic love between two people, and must have an emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.Romance novel There are many subgenres of the romance novel including fantasy, historical romance, paranormal fiction, and science fiction.Romance novel Walter Scott defined the literary fiction form of romance as a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents.Romance novel A thriving genre of works conventionally referred to as romance novels existed in ancient Greece.Anthony Giddens Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens (born 18 January 1938) is a British sociologist who is known for his theory of structuration and his holistic view of modern societies.Anthony Giddens He is considered to be one of the most prominent modern sociologists, the author of at least 34 books, published in at least 29 languages, issuing on average more than one book every year.Anthony Giddens In 2007, Giddens was listed as the fifth most-referenced author of books in the humanities.Anthony Giddens Four notable stages can be identified in his academic life.Anthony Giddens The first one involved outlining a new vision of what sociology is, presenting a theoretical and methodological understanding of that field, based on a critical reinterpretation of the classics.
Romance can be small acts, like making breakfast for your significant other. But it's portrayed as grand gestures which are unattainable. 	I agree it has been portrayed as impossible actions. Love consists of a variety of emotion and mental states.	Philosophy of mind Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind.Philosophy of mind The mind–body problem is a paradigm issue in philosophy of mind, although other issues are addressed, such as the hard problem of consciousness, and the nature of particular mental states.Philosophy of mind Aspects of the mind that are studied include mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness, the ontology of the mind, the nature of thought, and the relationship of the mind to the body.Philosophy of mind Dualism and monism are the two central schools of thought on the mind–body problem, although nuanced views have arisen that do not fit one or the other category neatly.Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Functionalism is a view in the theory of the mind.Functionalism (philosophy of mind) It states that mental states (beliefs, desires, being in pain, etc.)Functionalism (philosophy of mind) are constituted solely by their functional role – that is, they have causal relations to other mental states, numerous sensory inputs, and behavioral outputs.Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Functionalism developed largely as an alternative to the identity theory of mind and behaviorism.Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Functionalism is a theoretical level between the physical implementation and behavioral output.Functionalism (philosophy of mind) Therefore, it is different from its predecessors of Cartesian dualism (advocating independent mental and physical substances) and Skinnerian behaviorism and physicalism (declaring only physical substances) because it is only concerned with the effective functions of the brain, through its organization or its software programs.Theory of mind Theory of mind (often abbreviated ToM) is the ability to attribute mental states—beliefs, intents, desires, pretending, knowledge, etc.—to oneself, and to others, and to understand that others have beliefs, desires, intentions, and perspectives that are different from one's own.Theory of mind Deficits can occur in people with autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cocaine addiction, and brain damage suffered from alcohol's neurotoxicity.Theory of mind Although philosophical approaches to this exist, the theory of mind as such is distinct from the philosophy of mind.Theory of mind Theory of mind is a theory insofar as the mind is the only thing being directly observed.Free will Free will is the ability to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded.Free will Free will is closely linked to the concepts of responsibility, praise, guilt, sin, and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen.Free will It is also connected with the concepts of advice, persuasion, deliberation, and prohibition.Free will Traditionally, only actions that are freely willed are seen as deserving credit or blame.Free will There are numerous different concerns about threats to the possibility of free will, varying by how exactly it is conceived, which is a matter of some debate.Free will Some conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices in which the outcome has not been determined by past events.Mind–body dualism Mind–body dualism, or mind–body duality, is a view in the philosophy of mind that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical, or that the mind and body are distinct and separable.Mind–body dualism Thus, it encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter, and between subject and object, and is contrasted with other positions, such as physicalism and enactivism, in the mind–body problem.Mind–body dualism Aristotle shared Plato's view of multiple souls and further elaborated a hierarchical arrangement, corresponding to the distinctive functions of plants, animals, and people: a nutritive soul of growth and metabolism that all three share; a perceptive soul of pain, pleasure, and desire that only people and other animals share; and the faculty of reason that is unique to people only.Emotion Emotion is any conscious experience characterized by intense mental activity and a certain degree of pleasure or displeasure.Emotion Scientific discourse has drifted to other meanings and there is no consensus on a definition.Emotion Emotion is often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, and motivation.Emotion In some theories, cognition is an important aspect of emotion.Emotion Those acting primarily on the emotions they are feeling may seem as if they are not thinking, but mental processes are still essential, particularly in the interpretation of events.Emotion For example, the realization of our believing that we are in a dangerous situation and the subsequent arousal of our body's nervous system (rapid heartbeat and breathing, sweating, muscle tension) is integral to the experience of our feeling afraid.Jerry Fodor Jerry Alan Fodor (; April 22, 1935 – November 29, 2017) was an American philosopher and cognitive scientist.Jerry Fodor He held the position of State of New Jersey Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Rutgers University and was the author of many works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science, in which he laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses, among other ideas.Jerry Fodor He was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentation and as one of the principal philosophers of mind of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century.
It seems that in todays world it can be even harder to find a partner too.	Good point. Romance is associated with perfect partners, which is often unattainable. Sexual attraction often is stronger.	Cross-sex friendship A cross-sex friendship is a platonic relationship between an unrelated man and woman.Cross-sex friendship There are multiple types of cross-sex friendships, all defined by whether or not each party has a romantic attraction to each other, or perceives that the other is interested.Cross-sex friendship A few theories have been developed to explain the existence of such friendships.Cross-sex friendship Research has been done on why men and women initiate these relationships, how they are perceived by others, implications for children with cross-sex friendships, among others.Cross-sex friendship Cross-sex friendships can also create problems for those involved if either or both have or ever had any romantic feelings for the other.Sexual orientation Sexual orientation is an enduring pattern of romantic or sexual attraction (or a combination of these) to persons of the opposite sex or gender, the same sex or gender, or to both sexes or more than one gender.Sexual orientation These attractions are generally subsumed under heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality, while asexuality (the lack of sexual attraction to others) is sometimes identified as the fourth category.Sexual orientation These categories are aspects of the more nuanced nature of sexual identity and terminology.Sexual orientation For example, people may use other labels, such as pansexual or polysexual, or none at all.Sexual orientation According to the American Psychological Association, sexual orientation also refers to a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions.Bisexuality Bisexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction, or sexual behavior toward both males and females, or romantic or sexual attraction to people of any sex or gender identity; this latter aspect is sometimes alternatively termed pansexuality.Bisexuality The term bisexuality is mainly used in the context of human attraction to denote romantic or sexual feelings toward both men and women, and the concept is one of the three main classifications of sexual orientation along with heterosexuality and homosexuality, all of which exist on the heterosexual–homosexual continuum.Bisexuality A bisexual identity does not necessarily equate to equal sexual attraction to both sexes; commonly, people who have a distinct but not exclusive sexual preference for one sex over the other also identify themselves as bisexual.Asexuality Asexuality is the lack of sexual attraction to others, or low or absent interest in or desire for sexual activity.Asexuality It may be considered the lack of a sexual orientation, or one of the variations thereof, alongside heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality.Asexuality It may also be an umbrella term used to categorize a broader spectrum of various asexual sub-identities.Asexuality Asexuality is distinct from abstention from sexual activity and from celibacy, which are behavioral and generally motivated by factors such as an individual's personal or religious beliefs.Asexuality Sexual orientation, unlike sexual behavior, is believed to be enduring.Sexual attraction Sexual attraction is attraction on the basis of sexual desire or the quality of arousing such interest.Sexual attraction Sexual attractiveness or sex appeal is an individual's ability to attract the sexual or erotic interests of other people, and is a factor in sexual selection or mate choice.Sexual attraction The attraction can be to the physical or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context where they appear.Sexual attraction The attraction may be to a person's aesthetics or movements or to their voice or smell, besides other factors.Sexual attraction The attraction may be enhanced by a person's adornments, clothing, perfume or style.Romance (love) Romance is the expressive and pleasurable feeling from an emotional attraction towards another person.Romance (love) This feeling is associated with, but does not necessitate, sexual attraction.Romance (love) For most people it is eros rather than agape, philia, or storge.Romance (love) In the context of romantic love relationships, romance usually implies an expression of one's strong romantic love, or one's deep and strong emotional desires to connect with another person intimately or romantically.Romance (love) Historically, the term romance originates with the medieval ideal of chivalry as set out in its chivalric romance literature.Romance (love) Humans have a natural inclination to form bonds with one another through social interactions, be it through verbal communication or nonverbal gestures.Body odour and sexual attraction Odour is sensory stimulation of the olfactory membrane of the nose by a group of molecules.Body odour and sexual attraction Research has shown that certain body odours are connected to human sexual attraction.Body odour and sexual attraction Humans can make use of body odour subconsciously in order to identify whether a potential mate will pass on favourable traits to their offspring.Body odour and sexual attraction This is based on the fact body odour may provide significant cues about the genetic quality, health and reproductive success of a potential mate.Body odour and sexual attraction There is an extensive amount of research demonstrating that body odour affects sexual attraction in a number of ways including through human biology, the menstrual cycle and fluctuating asymmetry.

circumnavigation of the world, executed by the United States Navy nuclear-powered radar picket submarine in 1960 under the command of Captain Edward L. Beach.Operation Sandblast The New York Times described Tritons submerged circumnavigation of the Earth as a triumph of human prowess and engineering skill, a feat which the United States Navy can rank as one of its bright victories in man's ultimate conquest of the seas.Operation Sandblast The circumnavigation took place between 24 February and 25 April 1960, covering over 60 days and 21 hours.Operation Sandblast The route began and ended at the St. Peter and Paul Rocks in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean near the Equator.List of former state routes in Georgia (U.S. state) This is a List of former state routes in the U.S. state of Georgia.List of former state routes in Georgia (U.S. state) This list represents routes that traveled through the state but are no longer in operation, have been decommissioned, or have been renumbered.List of former state routes in Georgia (U.S. state) State Route 1E (SR 1E) was a route in Floyd County extending along present-day Old Cedartown Road, Park Avenue, Maple Avenue, East Sixth Street, and 2nd Avenue from US 27/SR 1 to US 27/SR 1, as well as US 411/SR 53.List of former state routes in Georgia (U.S. state) Originally part of US 27/SR 1, it was originally designated as SR 1 before being reassigned as SR 1E in 1955.List of former state routes in Georgia (U.S. state) US 27/SR 1 had been relocated along former SR 1 Spur, which is present-day US 27/SR 1 from Old Cedartown Road to present-day US 411 in 1938 with the old route remaining as SR 1 through Lindale.FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives by year, 1960 In 1960, the United States FBI, under Director J. Edgar Hoover, continued for an eleventh year to maintain a public list of the people it regarded as the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives.FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives by year, 1960 As 1960 began, seven of the ten places on the list remained filled by these elusive long-time fugitives, then still at large:   This would be a very successful year for capturing fugitives from the Ten Most Wanted list, clearing space for new fugitives to be added to the list.FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives by year, 1960 As a result, the FBI was able to add 22 new fugitives to the list over the course of the year, the highest since the 24 additions in the still (as of 2013) record year of 1953.Household A household consists of one or more people who live in the same dwelling and also share meals or living accommodation, and may consist of a single family or some other grouping of people.Household A single dwelling will be considered to contain multiple households if either meals or living space are not shared.Household The household is the basic unit of analysis in many social, microeconomic and government models, and is important to the fields of economics and inheritance.Household Household models include the family, varieties of blended families, share housing, group homes, boarding houses, houses in multiple occupation (UK), and a single room occupancy (US).1960 TANFL season The 1960 Tasmanian Australian National Football League (TANFL) premiership season was an Australian Rules football competition staged in Hobart, Tasmania over eighteen (18) roster rounds and four (4) finals series matches between 9 April and 17 September 1960.1960 TANFL season State Schools Old Boys Football Association (SSOBFA)  (Saturday, 24 September 1960)  (Saturday, 1 October 1960)   Jubilee Shield (Saturday, 14 May 1960)   Jubilee Shield (Saturday, 25 June 1960)   Interstate Match (Monday, 13 June 1960)   Interstate Match (Saturday, 23 July 1960)     (Saturday, 9 April.1960 TANFL season Saturday, 16 April & Monday, 18 April 1960)   (Saturday, 30 April 1960)  (Saturday, 7 May 1960)   (Monday, 14 May 1960)   (Saturday, 21 May 1960)   (Saturday, 28 May 1960)   (Saturday, 4 June 1960)   (Saturday, 11 June 1960)   (Monday, 13 June 1960)   (Saturday, 18 June 1960)   (Saturday, 2 July 1960)   (Saturday, 9 July 1960)   (Saturday, 16 July 1960)   (Saturday, 23 July 1960)   (Saturday, 30 July 1960)   (Saturday, 6 August 1960)   (Saturday, 13 August 1960)   (Saturday, 11 August 1962)   (Saturday, 27 August 1960)   (Saturday, 3 September 1960)   (Saturday, 10 September 1960)   (Saturday, 17 September 1960)   Source: All scores and statistics courtesy of the Hobart Mercury and Saturday Evening Mercury (SEM) publications.Bay of Pigs Invasion The Bay of Pigs Invasion (Spanish: Invasión de Playa Girón or Invasión de Bahía de Cochinos or Batalla de Girón) was a failed military invasion of Cuba undertaken by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)-sponsored paramilitary group Brigade 2506 on 17 April 1961.Bay of Pigs Invasion A counter-revolutionary military group (made up of mostly Cuban exiles who traveled to the United States after Castro's takeover, but also of some US military personnel), trained and funded by the CIA, Brigade 2506 fronted the armed wing of the Democratic Revolutionary Front (DRF) and intended to overthrow the increasingly communist government of Fidel Castro.
